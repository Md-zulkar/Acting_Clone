# Acting_Clone


Acting Clone – Real-Time Human Movement Mimicking System

Acting Clone is a cutting-edge computer vision project designed to capture, track, and replicate human movements in real time using advanced pose estimation techniques. Built with MediaPipe and OpenCV, this system creates an interactive visual experience by rendering both 2D skeletal structures and 3D pose plots.

This project is ideal for applications like virtual avatars, fitness monitoring, gaming, VR integration, and acting simulations.
📌 Why This Project?

    To understand and implement real-time pose detection using AI-based solutions.

    To visualize human motion in 2D and 3D, creating a foundation for interactive systems.

    To develop a base system for future enhancements like gesture-based control, acting feedback, and animation.

⚡ Key Features

✅ Real-time pose detection using MediaPipe Pose
✅ 2D Skeleton Rendering for clear body landmark visualization
✅ 3D Pose Plotting for in-depth motion analysis
✅ Lightweight and efficient system running on CPU
✅ Easy to extend for fitness, VR, gaming, and animation systems
🛠️ Technologies Used

    Python – Core programming language

    OpenCV – Image processing and video feed handling

    MediaPipe – Real-time pose estimation

    Matplotlib – 3D visualization of human movement

🚀 How It Works

    Capture Video Feed (Webcam or pre-recorded video)

    Detect Landmarks using MediaPipe Pose model

    Render Skeleton on top of the live feed for 2D visualization

    Generate 3D Pose Plot for better motion analysis

    Update in Real Time for smooth user interaction
